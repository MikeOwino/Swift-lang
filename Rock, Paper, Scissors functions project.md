Rock, Paper, Scissors
Rock, paper, scissors is a classic two player hand game dating back to ancient China.

Here are its universal rules:

Rock destroys scissors
Scissors cut paper
Paper covers rock
Keeping these guidelines in mind, we‚Äôll create a rock, paper, scissors program but with a modern twist - one of the players is a computer! üíª

rock, paper, scissors game

Our program will consist of 3 functions and utilize previously covered Swift concepts including if/else and switch statements to determine the winner amongst 2 players.

User Choice
1.
As a player, the first thing we‚Äôd do is make a choice between throwing rock, paper, or scissors. Let‚Äôs create a function that will handle this choice and ensure the player has entered valid input.

In RockPaperScissors.swift, declare a function, getUserChoice that will accept a single parameter, userInput of type, String.

The function should return a value of type, String.


Hint
Use the following syntax as a guide to set up your function:

func funcName(userInput: String) -> String { 
 
}
2.
Within the function, set up an if/else statement that will check the value of userInput. If the input is valid, the choice should get returned, otherwise, an error message displayed.

If userInput is "rock" OR userInput is "paper" OR userInput is "scissors", return userInput.

Otherwise, return the message, "You can only enter rock, paper, or scissors. Try again."


Hint
Within the function, set up the following conditional:

if variableName == "rock" || variableName == "paper" || variableName == "scissors"  {
  return userInput
} else {
  return "You can only enter rock, paper, or scissors. Try again."
}
3.
Call the function, getUserChoice(userInput:), and pass in an argument for userInput. Wrap the function in a print() statement.

Once you‚Äôve confirmed the function is working as expected, remove the print() statement.


Hint
To test the output of the function, add the following print() statement containing the function call:

print(funcName(userInput: "rock"))
Computer Choice
4.
In the game, when you‚Äôre making a choice between rock, paper, or scissors, your opponent is doing the same. In this case, your opponent is a computer. The next function we create will determine and display the computer‚Äôs choice in the game.

Declare a function, getComputerChoice, that will accept no parameters and return a value of type, String.

It will generate a random number and use a switch statement to decide which option to play.


Hint
Below the getUserChoice(userInput:) function, define the following function to handle the computer‚Äôs choice:

func getComputerChoice() -> String {
 
}
5.
Within the function, declare a constant, randomNumber and assign it the result of calling .random() on a range of Ints, 0 through 2.

On the following line, create a switch statement that will accept randomNumber as its expression and contain 3 cases.

Each case will check for one numerical value between 0 and 2 and return a move choice.

0 should return "rock"
1 should return "paper"
2 should return "scissors"
Conclude the switch statement with a default that returns the String, "Something went wrong".


Hint
First, generate a random number between a range of numerical values using the closed range operator and the .random() method. Store it in a constant:

let variableName = Int.random(in: 0...2) 
Next, set up a switch statement that returns a different move for each case:

switch variableName {
  case 0:
    return "rock"   
  case 1:
    return "paper"  
  case 2:
    return "scissors"
  default: 
    return "Something went wrong"
}
6.
Outside of the function, call getComputerChoice() and wrap it in a print() statement to see its output.

Running the program multiple times should result in a random choice displayed each time. Once you‚Äôve confirmed the expected output, remove the print() statement.


Hint
To test the functionality of the function, add the following print() statement containing the function call:

print(funcName())
Determine Winner
7.
Now that we‚Äôve set up each player‚Äôs move, it‚Äôs time to determine the winner.

Declare a function, determineWinner, that accepts two parameters:

userChoice of type, String
compChoice of type, String
Both parameters should be prepended with an _ to allow for an omitted argument label.

The function should return a value of type, String.


Hint
Below getComputerChoice(), define a function using the following syntax:

func funcName(_ userChoice: String, _ compChoice: String) -> String {
}
8.
Within the function, first declare a variable, decision and assign it the String, "It's a tie".

Next, create a switch statement that accepts userChoice as its expression.

In each case within the switch statement, we‚Äôll check for the value of userChoice and compare it to the computer‚Äôs move using an if/else if statement.

Start with the first case, when case is "rock":

check if compChoice is equal to "paper". If it is, set decision to "The computer won".
else if the compChoice is equal to "scissors", set decision to "The user won".

Hint
Inside the body of the function, declare the decision variable and assign it the String, "It's a tie.":

var variableName = "It's a tie"
"It's a tie" will get printed when the user‚Äôs and computer‚Äôs choices are the same. If the user‚Äôs and computer‚Äôs choices are different, the value of decision will get set to another String determined in the switch statement.

Below the variable, set up the following switch statement with its first case:

switch userVariable {
 case "rock":
   if compChoice == "paper" {
      decision = "The computer won"
   } else if compChoice == "scissors"{
      decision = "The user won"
   }
}
When the user‚Äôs choice is "rock", the case will execute, check the computer‚Äôs choice and determine a decision.

9.
Set up the second case when case is "paper":

check if compChoice is equal to "rock". If it is, set decision to "The user won".
else if the compChoice is equal to "scissors", set decision to "The computer won".

Hint
Within the switch statement, add the second case:

 case "paper":
   if compChoice == "rock" {
      decision = "The user won"
    } else if compChoice == "scissors"{
      decision = "The computer won"
    }
When the user‚Äôs choice is "paper", the case will execute, check the computer‚Äôs choice and determine a decision.

10.
Set up the third and final case where case is "scissors":

check if compChoice is equal to "rock". If it is, set decision to "The computer won".
else if the compChoice is equal to "paper", set decision to "The user won".
Below the final case, add a default statement that prints, "Something went wrong".

Conclude the function with a statement that returns decision.


Hint
Within the switch statement, add the final case:

case "scissors":
  if compChoice == "rock" {
    decision = "The computer won"
  } else if compChoice == "paper" {
    decision = "The user won"
  }
When the user‚Äôs choice is "scissors", the case will execute, check the computer‚Äôs choice and determine a decision.

Below, the final case, add the following default statement:

default: 
  print("Something went wrong")    
}
Lastly, add the following last line of the function to pass the value of decision from the function:

return decision
Display Result
11.
To play the game, we must first call the functions defined.

Call the function, getUserChoice(userInput:) and pass in "paper" as the argument for userInput. Store this function call in the constant, userChoice.
Call the function, getComputerChoice() and store it in the constant, compChoice.

Hint
Below all functions, declare two constants in the following form:

let userVariable = getUserChoice(userInput: "paper")
let compVariable = getComputerChoice()
12.
Add three consecutive print() statements to display the user‚Äôs choice, the computer‚Äôs choice, and the winner:

Use string interpolation in the first print() statement to output: "You threw [user choice]"
Use string interpolation in the second print() statement to output: "The computer threw [computer choice]"
Call the determineWinner() function and pass in the variables, userChoice and compChoice, as arguments.

Hint
Set up these print() statements in the following form:

print("You threw \(user variable)")
print("The computer threw \(computer variable)")
print(determineWinner(user variable, computer variable))
13.
Excellent work! üëè You‚Äôve utilized your knowledge of functions and previous fundamental Swift concepts to create a rock, paper, scissors game.

Run your program several times to see the computer‚Äôs different moves and outcome of the game each time. Test your code with different values for userInput and ensure your code is working as expected.
