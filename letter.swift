print("I embarked on my programming journey in 2009 when I enrolled in a CS course in college, not knowing what it meant nor where it could possibly take me.In the last ten years, programming has brought tremendous joy to my life and I met so many wonderful people through it. I am incredibly jealous of where you are right now because I would love to experience this all over again.Thank you for learning Swift with us. I canâ€™t wait to see what you create with it.
