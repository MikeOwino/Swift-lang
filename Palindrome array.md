Palindrome
A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequences of characters that remains the same when its characters are reversed, such as:

"madam"
"racecar"
"10801"
Sentence-length palindromes may be written when allowances are made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers, such as:

"Was it a car or a cat I saw?"
"A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!"
Write a Palindrome.swift program that checks whether or not an array contains a palindrome.

Setting Up
1.
Let‚Äôs get started by creating an array named text with the value: ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]

We‚Äôll be using text later and check if it actually is or isn‚Äôt a palindrome.


Hint
The declaration should look like:

var text = ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
To be explicit about the type, we can also add a [String] type:

var text: [String] = ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
2.
Next, declare an empty array called reversed of type String.

This is where we will store the reversed version of the text array.


Hint
reverse can be declared with:

var reversed = [String]()
The While Loop
3.
Okay, but how do we get the reverse of text?

One way is to iterate from the end of the text array to its beginning and add each character one by one to reverse.

To do this, we can use a while loop.

First things first, create a counter variable that starts at 1 less than the size of text using the .count property.


Hint
The counter will look something like:

var counter = text.count - 1
Remember, the .count property does not have parentheses.

4.
Next, create a while loop that has the condition of counter greater than or equal to 0.


Hint
The syntax for a while loop looks like:

while condition {
 
  // Loop body
 
}
5.
Inside the loop body, make the counter decrement one a time.

After all, we don‚Äôt want to get stuck in an infinite loop!


Hint
The code will looke like:

var counter = text.count - 1
 
while counter >= 0 {
 
  // Some code
  counter = counter - 1
 
}
Alternatively, we could use the -= syntax:

counter -= 1
6.
Now we have a while loop, let‚Äôs write the instruction that to add to our reversed array.

Before the decrement of the counter, add a line of code that appends the character in text at index counter to the end of reversed array.


Hint
Here, we are adding text[counter] to the end of reversed using .append():

var counter = text.count - 1
 
while(counter >= 0) {
 
  reversed.append(text[counter])
  counter = counter - 1
 
}
Checking for Palindrome
7.
Now we have reversed, the exact flip of text, we now want our program to check whether or not we have a palindrome.

Create a conditional that prints out ‚ÄúWe have a palindrome!‚Äù if text equals to reversed.


Hint
The syntax for the if statement looks like:

if condition {
 
  // Some code
 
}
8.
Then, create an else clause that prints out a message if it does not equal.

This means that we don‚Äôt have a palindrome.


Hint
The if/else statement syntax looks like:

if condition {
 
  // Some code
 
} else {
 
  // Some code
 
}
Optional

Congrats! You have created a palindrome checker. ü•≥

To make sure your program works, try it out with different text arrays:

["l", "e", "v", "e", "l"]
["a", "n", "n", "a"]
To go a step further, try rewriting the code using a for-in loop or a stride() function.
